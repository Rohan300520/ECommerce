## Database File

The SQLite database file (`ecommerce.db`) will be created in the project root directory. This file contains all your data and can be backed up or transferred as needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Port already in use:**
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

**Dependencies not installing:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Database issues:**
- Delete `ecommerce.db` file and restart the application to recreate the database
- Check console for any database initialization errors

The application should now be running locally with all the dummy data and user accounts ready for testing!
